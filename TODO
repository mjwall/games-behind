TODOs

First cut
- push to github
- add ensime plugin
- import xml files, probably as files, will need to recreate the mongodb where I stored them last year
- give route to view files
- add scalate templating
- design json representation of games behind for entire year
- scala code to parse one xml
- scala to use parsed xml and create/update year json
- javascript to display chart by league and division (highcharts?)
- update readme
- figure out scala test to test all the scala
- look into something to test the javascript
- maybe hook into travis-ci

For 2013-2012 season
- create code to grab new xml and store
  - ensure it gets the correct day
- create wrapper to get xml and process to yearly json
- create cron to call wrapper

Later
- Maybe create new g8 that works (does no one care about wars anymore?)
- write blog post about experiences
- marketing so the Orioles will hire me

DONEs
- pick framework, play2, scalatra, unfiltered
  - going with unfiltered, scalatra is sinatra and play makes me mad cause I can't make a war
- skeleton project (start with https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered-war.g8)
  - had to update some dependencies, as it wasn't building
  - also added ContextPath so I could deploy to tomcat as a war
- create project on openshift (https://gamesbehind-mjwall.rhcloud.com/)
- deploy skeleton
