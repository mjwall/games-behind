Games-Behind
====================

This project is intended to chart a MLB season by looking at how the "games behind" numbers change over time.  More info to come.

Running on OpenShift
----------------------------

Currently, I am pushing this code to Openshift, and you can see it running at https://gamesbehind-mjwall.rhcloud.com/

There is nothing interesting there yet, but some routes are hooked up if you want to look at the code.

Source data
----------------------------

I am getting data from http://erikberg.com/mlb.  When I started this project last year, I could not find a free source of the games behind historical data, only the current snapshot.  I started capturing this data every day with intent of making a graphic.  As I have been looking at erikberg.com lately, I see that he is now providing historical data through 2008 and even has a graphic similiar to what I am trying to do at http://erikberg.com/mlb/charts.  It is a fun exercise for me, so I'll keep going.  Big thanks to Erik Berg though, I consider him a hero for his work.

Motivation
----------------------------

Lastly, a quick shout of for one of my favorite books of all time, "Baseball Hacks" by Joseph Adler http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Hacks-Analyzing-Winning-Statistics/dp/0596009429.  He is another hero of mine.  The idea for this site all started with his book.
